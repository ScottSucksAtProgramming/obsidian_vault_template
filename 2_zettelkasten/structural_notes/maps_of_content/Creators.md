# Creators


Creators are collected within this vault as part of the personal knowledge management aspect of the vault. They are kept for citing purposes.

The Add Creator button below will create a new note for a creator and lists sources and literature notes related to them. A creator uses the [[Creator Template]].

```button
name Add Creator
type note(2_zettelkasten/bibliographical_notes/creator_notes/TKTK, split) template
action Creator Template
templater true
color green
```
