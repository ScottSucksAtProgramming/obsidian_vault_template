# People


People who's relationships are important to me are given notes which maintain important information about them. This Map of Content collects all the people and lists them

The Create Person below will create a new note for a specific person. A person uses the [[Person Template]].

```button
name Create Person
type note(1_lifeOS/people_notes/TKTK, split) template
action Person Template
templater true
color green
```
## People Notes


```dataview
LIST
FROM "1_lifeOS/people_notes" and -#structure/moc
SORT file.cday DESC
```
