# Monday, November 27, 2023

<< [[2023-11-26|Yesterday]] | [[2023-11-28|Tomorrow]] >>

- Updated many templates. Templates for periodic notes now contain their direct container as a reference (i.e. Daily notes link to the weekly note they belong to. Weekly notes link to the monthly note they belong to, etc).
- Created multiple maps of content including - [[Books]], [[Books (Unread)|Unread Books]], and [[Templates]].
- Added multiple commands to the [[QuickAdd Plugin]]: `Create new person`, `Create new creator`, `Create meeting`, `Create prompt`, `Create Quote`, `Create recipe`. `Create term`, and `Create tool`.
- Tested the [[Book Search Plugin]] and added [[The Name of the Wind]] one of my favorite books.
